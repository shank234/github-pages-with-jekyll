I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk a bit about myself!
My name is Anagha Shankar.
I love playing tennis!

One of the social media platforms I use the most is Instagram. [This is what my account looks like] (https://www.instagram.com/anaghashankarr/)

I hope you enjoyed learning a little bit about me!
